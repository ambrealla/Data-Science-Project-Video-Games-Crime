This is a project I've worked extensively on for the course, Data Science in Practice. The course description is officially as follows: "Data science is multidisciplinary, covering computer science, statistics, cognitive science and psychology, data visualization, artificial intelligence and machine learning, among others. This course teaches critical skills needed to pursue a data science career using hands-on programming and experimental challenges."

In this course, we were encouraged to conduct our own data science project regarding a topic of our own choice. I suggested examining video games and violence to my team, which they also indicated interest towards. In the report, you will find several different analyses examining different aspects of video games (sales, releases, etc.) and how they may or may not relate to crime.

My team and I explored several different Python packages, including pandas, seaborn, and datetime. You will see these packages being used together to support our inquiry. Our datasets are sourced from Kaggle, and we clean and combine them to prepare the data for our analysis of interest.
